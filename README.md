# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

This project contains one file : run_analysis.R which if executed will produce a text file as result of following actions:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The file assumes Samsung data is in your working directory (data must be put inside UCI HAR Dataset folder in working directory in same structure after downloaded zipped data is extracted to working directory), otherwise error may occur.
